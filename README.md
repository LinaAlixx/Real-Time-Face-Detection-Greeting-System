This project uses Computer Vision to detect human faces in real time using a webcam.
When a face is detected, the system greets the person with a voice message using
text-to-speech technology.

The project was developed and used during the AI Club orientation event at the
University of Jeddah to welcome attendees in an interactive and engaging way.
It demonstrates the practical application of face detection and human–computer
interaction using Python.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV (Haar Cascade Face Detection)
- Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3)
- Computer Vision
